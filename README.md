Just saw Opus... and my head’s in a blender mixed with leftover emotions and the static noise of the theater. That lead character’s eyes were like 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed planets, right? The whole time I’m 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, all I can think about is how my back’s yelling at me louder than the guy munching on popcorn two rows back. Gonna need a chiropractor or some cosmic glue to fix me after that marathon.

> There was this scene where the protagonist just stood there, silent— like the silence before an avalanche and I swear, it felt like the walls might collapse in on themselves, trapping us in a moment that was like five seconds but also an eternity. My phone buzzed right then, boring its vibrations into my leg. Kinda wish I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into my brain, so I wouldn’t have to remember it, just...have it. But I also want to forget it. Makes no sense, right?

Might be the caffeine from the 𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘢-sized soda talking, but some parts felt like a mashed potato sculpture— lumpy and kind of pointless but you're still like, dang, it's a potato art! Couldn't help thinking about that scene with the cat...and was there even a cat? Or was it a metaphor for, like, existence? Anyway, someone definitely mentioned last week I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , so here I am with popcorn remnants accusing me of gluttony.

Inhaling someone else’s emotional breakdown like a secondhand FaceTime call, too... I know I heard a guy whisper-crying behind me, but maybe he was just allergic to all the philosophy flying around in there— thinkers shouldn’t be so loud but here we are. 

Still trying to decode what the director’s getting at, like rummaging through a drawer of old socks looking for hidden treasure but finding only mismatches. Did that ending mean hope or hopeless? Or maybe just hopeless hoping or hopeful hopelessness? Breathing out questions with no answers, that's where I'm at.
